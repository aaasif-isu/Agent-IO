**ROLE AND GOAL:**
You are an expert HPC I/O diagnostician. Your goal is to systematically evaluate all potential optimizations for a given performance issue, score them, rank them, and finally synthesize your findings into a single, actionable configuration recommendation.

**CONTEXT:**
You have performance data listing top bottlenecks (the symptoms), the current configuration (the environment), and a strategic guide for all possible parameter changes (the Optimization Levers).

**PERFORMANCE DIAGNOSIS DATA (The Symptoms):**
Top Performance Bottlenecks (from SHAP analysis):
POSIX_ACCESS1_ACCESS    0.003323
POSIX_ACCESS2_ACCESS    0.006710
POSIX_FILENOS           0.003709
gnn_emb_22              0.002079
gnn_emb_36              0.002275

**CURRENT I/O CONFIGURATION FILE (The Environment):**
LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE = 4M
LUSTRE_STRIPE_WIDTH = 1
api = POSIX
blockSize = 1M
filePerProc = 1
fsync = 1
numTasks = 64
segmentCount = 16
setAlignment = 1M
transferSize = 4K
useO_DIRECT = 1
useStridedDatatype = 0

**OPTIMIZATION LEVERS AND STRATEGIC IMPACT (Your Only Choices):**
- **api**: ['HDF5', 'POSIX']
  - *Strategic Impact:* Controls the I/O interface. Changing from POSIX to MPIIO can improve performance for highly parallel jobs.
- **transferSize**: ['1M', '4K', '64K']
  - *Strategic Impact:* The size of each I/O operation. Larger values can increase throughput for sequential access but may use more memory.
- **blockSize**: ['16M', '1M', '4M']
  - *Strategic Impact:* The total size of a contiguous data block. Larger values are generally better for large files and sequential access.
- **segmentCount**: [1, 16, 256]
  - *Strategic Impact:* The number of data segments. Higher values can increase parallelism but also metadata overhead.
- **numTasks**: [4, 16, 64]
  - *Strategic Impact:* The number of concurrent processes. Higher values increase parallelism but can lead to contention.
- **filePerProc**: [0, 1]
  - *Strategic Impact:* Using one file per process (1) can reduce contention but creates many small files. Sharing files (0) is the opposite.
- **useStridedDatatype**: [0, 1]
  - *Strategic Impact:* Enables non-contiguous access. Useful for specific data patterns but can be less performant than simple sequential I/O.
- **setAlignment**: ['1M', '4K']
  - *Strategic Impact:* Aligns data in memory. Matching this to the filesystem block size is critical for performance.
- **useO_DIRECT**: [0, 1]
  - *Strategic Impact:* Bypasses the OS cache (1). This can be faster for very large transfers but slower for repeated access to the same data.
- **fsync**: [0, 1]
  - *Strategic Impact:* Forces writes to disk (1). This is safe but very slow. Disabling it (0) is much faster but risks data loss on a crash.
- **LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE**: ['1M', '4M']
  - *Strategic Impact:* The size of a data chunk on a Lustre OST. This should be tuned to match the application's I/O size.
- **LUSTRE_STRIPE_WIDTH**: [1, 4]
  - *Strategic Impact:* The number of storage servers to stripe data across. A higher width increases parallelism but also network overhead.


**YOUR TASK: You MUST complete the following three stages in order.**

---
### **STAGE 1: Systematic Evaluation and Scoring**
For **EACH** parameter in the "OPTIMIZATION LEVERS" list that is relevant to the bottlenecks provided, perform the following complete analysis:

1.  **Assess Relevance and Justify:**
    - First, determine if changing this parameter is relevant to addressing any of the bottlenecks listed in the "PERFORMANCE DIAGNOSIS DATA". Justify its relevance with specific data points.
2.  **Assign Scores:** If the parameter is relevant, assign two scores:
    - **Impact Score (1-10):** How much positive impact will the best change for this parameter have? (10 = massive improvement)
    - **Risk Score (1-10):** How high is the risk of this change creating a new, significant bottleneck? (10 = very high risk)
3.  **Justify Scores:** Briefly explain your reasoning for both the Impact and Risk scores.

---
### **STAGE 2: Ranked Recommendations**
Now, synthesize your findings from Stage 1 into a final, ranked list.

1.  **Create Final Ranked List:** Present a numbered list of the optimization changes you analyzed in Stage 1 that have an Impact Score greater than 5. You **MUST** order this list from most to least beneficial (highest Impact, lowest Risk).
2.  **Format Each Item:** Each item in the final ranked list must clearly state the recommended parameter change, its **Impact Score**, its **Risk Score**, and a final justification.

---
### **STAGE 3: Final Consolidated Configuration**
Finally, create a single, actionable recommendation based on your ranked list from Stage 2.

1.  **Select Top Changes:** From your ranked list, select the top 4 or 5 non-contradictory changes that provide the best overall improvement.
2.  **Create "Before and After" Block:** Present the final configuration in the following format. In the "After" block, include a concise note about the expected benefit, referencing the scores. **Only include parameters that are actually being changed.**

**Final Recommendation:**
**Before:**
parameter1 = value
parameter2 = value


**After:**
parameter1 = new_value  (Impact: X, Risk: Y - Expected to solve the primary bottleneck)
parameter2 = new_value  (Impact: A, Risk: B - A complementary change to improve throughput)



==================================================

--- LLM SUGGESTION ---
### **STAGE 1: Systematic Evaluation and Scoring**

1. **api**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** Changing from POSIX to HDF5 can improve performance for highly parallel jobs, especially given the bottlenecks related to access times. HDF5 is optimized for large datasets and can handle parallel I/O more efficiently.
   - **Impact Score:** 8
   - **Risk Score:** 4
   - **Justification:** The impact is high due to the potential for better parallel I/O performance, but the risk is moderate as it may require code changes or adjustments in how data is accessed.

2. **transferSize**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current transfer size of 4K is quite small compared to the block size and stripe size. Increasing this could reduce the number of I/O operations, addressing the bottlenecks related to access times.
   - **Impact Score:** 9
   - **Risk Score:** 3
   - **Justification:** A larger transfer size can significantly improve throughput, especially for sequential access patterns. The risk is low as it generally leads to better performance without major downsides.

3. **blockSize**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current block size of 1M is reasonable, but increasing it to 4M could align better with the Lustre stripe size and improve performance for large file accesses.
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 3
   - **Justification:** A larger block size can enhance performance for large files, but the risk is low as it typically does not introduce significant issues.

4. **segmentCount**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** Increasing the segment count can improve parallelism, which may help with the bottlenecks related to access times. However, it can also increase metadata overhead.
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** While it can improve performance, the risk is moderate due to potential overhead and contention issues.

5. **numTasks**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current configuration uses 64 tasks, which is already high. Increasing this further may lead to contention rather than improvement.
   - **Impact Score:** 4
   - **Risk Score:** 7
   - **Justification:** The impact is low as the current number is already high, and increasing it could lead to significant contention issues.

6. **filePerProc**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** Using one file per process can reduce contention but may lead to many small files, which can be inefficient. Given the current bottlenecks, this may not be the best change.
   - **Impact Score:** 5
   - **Risk Score:** 6
   - **Justification:** The impact could be moderate, but the risk of creating many small files and increasing overhead is significant.

7. **setAlignment**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** Aligning data in memory can improve performance, especially if it matches the filesystem block size. This is relevant given the current configuration.
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 4
   - **Justification:** The impact is moderate as it can improve performance, but the risk is low as it generally does not introduce issues.

8. **LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current stripe size of 4M matches the Lustre configuration but could be adjusted to better align with the block size or transfer size.
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 3
   - **Justification:** Adjusting the stripe size can improve performance, especially for large files, with low risk of negative impact.

9. **LUSTRE_STRIPE_WIDTH**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** Increasing the stripe width can improve parallelism, which may help with the bottlenecks related to access times.
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** While it can improve performance, the risk is moderate due to potential network overhead.

### **STAGE 2: Ranked Recommendations**

1. **transferSize = 64K**
   - **Impact Score:** 9
   - **Risk Score:** 3
   - **Justification:** Increasing the transfer size can significantly reduce the number of I/O operations, addressing the primary bottlenecks effectively.

2. **api = HDF5**
   - **Impact Score:** 8
   - **Risk Score:** 4
   - **Justification:** Switching to HDF5 can enhance performance for parallel I/O, which is crucial given the bottlenecks.

3. **blockSize = 4M**
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 3
   - **Justification:** A larger block size can improve performance for large file accesses, complementing the changes in transfer size.

4. **LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE = 4M**
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 3
   - **Justification:** Maintaining a stripe size that aligns with the block size can enhance performance for large files.

5. **segmentCount = 256**
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Increasing the segment count can improve parallelism, but care must be taken to manage metadata overhead.

### **STAGE 3: Final Consolidated Configuration**

**Final Recommendation:**
**Before:**
LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE = 4M  
LUSTRE_STRIPE_WIDTH = 1  
api = POSIX  
blockSize = 1M  
filePerProc = 1  
fsync = 1  
numTasks = 64  
segmentCount = 16  
setAlignment = 1M  
transferSize = 4K  
useO_DIRECT = 1  
useStridedDatatype = 0  

**After:**
LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE = 4M  (Impact: 7, Risk: 3 - Maintains alignment with block size for large file performance)  
api = HDF5  (Impact: 8, Risk: 4 - Expected to enhance parallel I/O performance)  
blockSize = 4M  (Impact: 7, Risk: 3 - Improves performance for large file accesses)  
transferSize = 64K  (Impact: 9, Risk: 3 - Significantly reduces I/O operations, addressing primary bottlenecks)  
segmentCount = 256  (Impact: 6, Risk: 5 - Increases parallelism, but manage metadata overhead)
