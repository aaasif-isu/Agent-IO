**ROLE AND GOAL:**
You are an expert HPC I/O diagnostician. Your goal is to systematically evaluate all potential optimizations for a given performance issue, score them, rank them, and finally synthesize your findings into a single, actionable configuration recommendation.

**CONTEXT:**
You have performance data listing top bottlenecks (the symptoms), the current configuration (the environment), and a strategic guide for all possible parameter changes (the Optimization Levers).

**PERFORMANCE DIAGNOSIS DATA (The Symptoms):**
Top Performance Bottlenecks (from SHAP analysis):
POSIX_ACCESS1_ACCESS    0.003323
POSIX_ACCESS2_ACCESS    0.006710
POSIX_FILENOS           0.003709
gnn_emb_22              0.002079
gnn_emb_36              0.002275

Top Most Frequent Raw I/O Operations (from Darshan counters):
POSIX_ACCESS1_ACCESS          332
POSIX_ACCESS4_ACCESS         1273
POSIX_BYTES_WRITTEN          3935
POSIX_FILE_ALIGNMENT    152051708
POSIX_MEM_ALIGNMENT          1208

**CURRENT I/O CONFIGURATION FILE (The Environment):**
LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE = 4M
LUSTRE_STRIPE_WIDTH = 4
api = POSIX
blockSize = 1M
filePerProc = 1
fsync = 1
numTasks = 64
segmentCount = 16
setAlignment = 1M
transferSize = 4K
useO_DIRECT = 1
useStridedDatatype = 0

**OPTIMIZATION LEVERS AND STRATEGIC IMPACT (Your Only Choices):**
- **api**: ['HDF5', 'POSIX']
  - *Strategic Impact:* Controls the I/O interface. Changing from POSIX to MPIIO can improve performance for highly parallel jobs.
- **transferSize**: ['1M', '4K', '64K']
  - *Strategic Impact:* The size of each I/O operation. Larger values can increase throughput for sequential access but may use more memory.
- **blockSize**: ['16M', '1M', '4M']
  - *Strategic Impact:* The total size of a contiguous data block. Larger values are generally better for large files and sequential access.
- **segmentCount**: [1, 16, 256]
  - *Strategic Impact:* The number of data segments. Higher values can increase parallelism but also metadata overhead.
- **numTasks**: [4, 16, 64]
  - *Strategic Impact:* The number of concurrent processes. Higher values increase parallelism but can lead to contention.
- **filePerProc**: [0, 1]
  - *Strategic Impact:* Using one file per process (1) can reduce contention but creates many small files. Sharing files (0) is the opposite.
- **useStridedDatatype**: [0, 1]
  - *Strategic Impact:* Enables non-contiguous access. Useful for specific data patterns but can be less performant than simple sequential I/O.
- **setAlignment**: ['1M', '4K']
  - *Strategic Impact:* Aligns data in memory. Matching this to the filesystem block size is critical for performance.
- **useO_DIRECT**: [0, 1]
  - *Strategic Impact:* Bypasses the OS cache (1). This can be faster for very large transfers but slower for repeated access to the same data.
- **fsync**: [0, 1]
  - *Strategic Impact:* Forces writes to disk (1). This is safe but very slow. Disabling it (0) is much faster but risks data loss on a crash.
- **LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE**: ['1M', '4M']
  - *Strategic Impact:* The size of a data chunk on a Lustre OST. This should be tuned to match the application's I/O size.
- **LUSTRE_STRIPE_WIDTH**: [1, 4]
  - *Strategic Impact:* The number of storage servers to stripe data across. A higher width increases parallelism but also network overhead.


**YOUR TASK: You MUST complete the following three stages in order.**

---
### **STAGE 1: Systematic Evaluation and Scoring**
For **EACH** parameter in the "OPTIMIZATION LEVERS" list that is relevant to the bottlenecks provided, perform the following complete analysis:

1.  **Assess Relevance and Justify:**
    - First, determine if changing this parameter is relevant by finding **corroborating evidence in BOTH** the SHAP data and the Darshan counters. If it's not supported by both, it is not relevant. State this corroborated evidence explicitly.
2.  **Assign Scores:** If the parameter is relevant, assign two scores:
    - **Impact Score (1-10):** How much positive impact will the best change for this parameter have? (10 = massive improvement)
    - **Risk Score (1-10):** How high is the risk of this change creating a new, significant bottleneck? (10 = very high risk)
3.  **Justify Scores:** Briefly explain your reasoning for both the Impact and Risk scores.

---
### **STAGE 2: Ranked Recommendations**
Now, synthesize your findings from Stage 1 into a final, ranked list.

1.  **Create Final Ranked List:** Present a numbered list of the optimization changes you analyzed in Stage 1 that have an Impact Score greater than 5. You **MUST** order this list from most to least beneficial (highest Impact, lowest Risk).
2.  **Format Each Item:** Each item in the final ranked list must clearly state the recommended parameter change, its **Impact Score**, its **Risk Score**, and a final justification.

---
### **STAGE 3: Final Consolidated Configuration**
Finally, create a single, actionable recommendation based on your ranked list from Stage 2.

1.  **Select Top Changes:** From your ranked list, select the top 4 or 5 non-contradictory changes that provide the best overall improvement.
2.  **Create "Before and After" Block:** Present the final configuration in the following format. In the "After" block, include a concise note about the expected benefit, referencing the scores. **Only include parameters that are actually being changed.**

**Final Recommendation:**
**Before:**
parameter1 = value
parameter2 = value


**After:**
parameter1 = new_value  (Impact: X, Risk: Y - Expected to solve the primary bottleneck)
parameter2 = new_value  (Impact: A, Risk: B - A complementary change to improve throughput)



==================================================

--- LLM SUGGESTION ---
### **STAGE 1: Systematic Evaluation and Scoring**

1. **api**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The SHAP data indicates high access times for POSIX operations, and the Darshan counters show a high frequency of POSIX access operations. This suggests that switching to a more efficient I/O interface like MPIIO could be beneficial.
   - **Impact Score:** 8
   - **Risk Score:** 6
   - **Justification:** Changing to MPIIO can significantly improve performance for parallel jobs, but it may introduce complexity and require code changes, which poses a moderate risk.

2. **transferSize**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The high frequency of small I/O operations (e.g., POSIX_ACCESS1_ACCESS and POSIX_ACCESS4_ACCESS) suggests that increasing the transfer size could reduce the number of I/O operations and improve throughput.
   - **Impact Score:** 9
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Increasing the transfer size can lead to better performance, especially for sequential access patterns, with a moderate risk of increased memory usage.

3. **blockSize**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current block size of 1M may not be optimal given the high frequency of I/O operations. A larger block size could improve performance for large files and sequential access.
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 4
   - **Justification:** A larger block size can enhance throughput, especially for large datasets, with a relatively low risk of negative impact.

4. **segmentCount**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current segment count of 16 may not be optimal given the high frequency of I/O operations. Increasing the segment count could improve parallelism.
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** While increasing segment count can enhance parallelism, it may also introduce metadata overhead, leading to a moderate risk.

5. **numTasks**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current configuration uses 64 tasks, which is already high. Increasing this further may lead to contention rather than improvement.
   - **Impact Score:** 3
   - **Risk Score:** 7
   - **Justification:** Increasing the number of tasks beyond 64 is unlikely to yield benefits and could create contention, leading to a high risk of performance degradation.

6. **filePerProc**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current setting of 1 file per process may lead to contention, especially with high-frequency access patterns. Changing this could reduce contention.
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Sharing files can reduce contention but may lead to performance issues with many small files, posing a moderate risk.

7. **setAlignment**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current alignment of 1M may not match the Lustre block size optimally. Adjusting this could improve performance.
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 4
   - **Justification:** Aligning data correctly can enhance performance, especially for large transfers, with a low risk of negative impact.

8. **LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current stripe size of 4M may not be optimal for the I/O patterns observed. Adjusting this could improve performance.
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Matching the stripe size to the I/O size can enhance throughput, with a moderate risk of network overhead.

9. **LUSTRE_STRIPE_WIDTH**
   - **Relevance and Justification:** The current stripe width of 4 may limit parallelism. Increasing this could improve performance.
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Increasing the stripe width can enhance parallelism but may introduce network overhead, leading to a moderate risk.

### **STAGE 2: Ranked Recommendations**

1. **transferSize = 1M**
   - **Impact Score:** 9
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Increasing the transfer size can significantly reduce the number of I/O operations, improving throughput.

2. **api = MPIIO**
   - **Impact Score:** 8
   - **Risk Score:** 6
   - **Justification:** Switching to MPIIO can enhance performance for parallel jobs, though it may require code changes.

3. **blockSize = 4M**
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 4
   - **Justification:** A larger block size can improve performance for large files and sequential access.

4. **filePerProc = 0**
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Sharing files can reduce contention, although it may lead to performance issues with many small files.

5. **LUSTRE_STRIPE_SIZE = 1M**
   - **Impact Score:** 7
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Adjusting the stripe size to match the I/O size can enhance throughput.

6. **setAlignment = 4K**
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 4
   - **Justification:** Correct alignment can improve performance, especially for large transfers.

7. **LUSTRE_STRIPE_WIDTH = 1**
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Increasing the stripe width can enhance parallelism but may introduce network overhead.

8. **segmentCount = 256**
   - **Impact Score:** 6
   - **Risk Score:** 5
   - **Justification:** Increasing segment count can improve parallelism but may also introduce metadata overhead.
